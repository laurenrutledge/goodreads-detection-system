feature_engineering_tier2_labeling.py
-------------------------------------
This file contains the reusable functions required for the labeling phase leading into the
logistic classification training phase of this project.

The functions included in this file carry out the following:
- Extra interaction/ratio feature creations, which are then added to the dataset in columns
- Assigning a substantiveness label based on thresholds that were pre-determined in effort to
evenly split responses amongst the 5 "quality ratings"
